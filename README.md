üìä COVID-19 Vaccination Drive Optimization Using PERT & CPM | Python
This project aims to optimize the COVID-19 vaccination campaign using PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) and CPM (Critical Path Method) for effective planning, scheduling, and resource management.

üîç Project Focus:
Strategic planning of the COVID-19 vaccination drive in India using project management and data science techniques to:

Improve vaccine supply logistics

Minimize total vaccination time

Allocate health workers and centers efficiently

Reduce risks and delays in the execution process

üí° Key Features:
Python Code (Colab): Complete implementation of PERT & CPM, including activity time estimates, critical path identification, and project crashing to minimize duration

Project Scheduling Logic: Time analysis, float calculation, and identification of high-risk activities using zero or low float

Data-Driven Planning: Supports better decision-making through modeled timelines, dependencies, and optimized resource use

üìà Tools & Technologies:
Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Models: PERT/CPM for project scheduling and optimization

üìÇ Files Included:
covidproject-code.ipynb: Jupyter notebook implementing all PERT/CPM logic

covidproject-ppt.pptx: Presentation covering objectives, methodology, timelines, and conclusions

‚úÖ Outcome:
Efficient vaccine distribution modeled in 30.17 days

Critical path activities were identified and prioritized for timely execution

Crash slope analysis guided cost-effective time reduction

Demonstrated how PERT & CPM can enhance planning for large-scale public health campaigns

üí° Purpose
This project serves as a blueprint for planning and executing large-scale public health campaigns. The use of PERT and CPM ensured strategic organization and timely completion, highlighting the importance of analytical planning in real-world health crises.
